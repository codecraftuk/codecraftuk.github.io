<p><br />For our July event, we’re going to have a Lean Coffee session. Everyone has questions about software development and engineering techniques that they’d like to discuss with a like-minded group: this is your chance.</p>

<p>Whether you want to talk about TDD in practice, Modern Cloud, microservices, structuring code, or anything else related to developing high-quality software, bring along your topic and questions and discuss them.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter if you don’t have a topic, you may be able to provide valuable perspective for others, or learn something new by just listening. It also doesn’t matter if you don’t know the Lean Coffee format, it’s simple and we’ll take the time to explain it before we get started.</p>

<p>No ticket required.</p>

<p>Embark on a coding adventure like never before! Join us for an uplifting virtual event where you’ll step into the shoes of a software engineer tasked with programming an elevator system using JavaScript. Get ready to roll up your sleeves and dive deep into the world of programming as you tackle real-life challenges in elevator logic. From defining floor behaviour to optimizing passenger flow, this hands-on experience will put your JavaScript skills to the test.</p>

<h3 id="do-i-need-to-know-javascript-already">Do I need to know Javascript already?</h3>

<p>No, we will be working in small groups. This session is designed for folks who know Javascript and those that don’t.</p>

<h3 id="do-i-need-to-install-anything-before-the-event">Do I need to install anything before the event?</h3>

<p>No. We will be using an online website to run the simulation.</p>

<p>It’s not a book club in the traditional sense. Instead, we invite attendees to Bring-a-Book (or blog post, podcast, other media) that has influenced them.</p>

<p>This year, we went back to the Raven in Glasgow. It was a cold and stormy night, and only 2 people made it.</p>

  <li>“Object-Oriented Design” by Peter Coad and Edward Yourdon</li>
  <li>“Object-Oriented Analysis” by Peter Coad and Edward Yourdon</li>

<p>It’s January! That means we’re doing our annual Bring-a-Book event!</p>

<p>We need you to bring along a book that you’ve enjoyed in the realm of software, work, or a related field. Share with everyone else why you enjoy it, what you got from it, why others might want to read it. With everyone else doing the same, you can set up your New Year reading list with some great starting points!</p>

<p>It doesn’t even <em>have</em> to be a book: it can be a blogpost, a podcast, a news article or anything else worth sharing. We recommend that the chosen texts are non-fiction as it keeps the conversations more grounded.</p>

<p>Our aim is to encourage everyone to share ideas that have inspired them, and hopefully help with narrowing down worthy reads to put on your 2024 reading list.</p>

<p>We’ll chat either as one group, or break into smaller groups, depending on how many people come along.</p>

<p>Happy reading!</p>

<p>The days are getting shorter, and the Xmas stuff has been in the shops for months now, but we have our last event of 2023 to warm your hearts.</p>

<p>Since 2015, folks have been participating in the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/about">“Advent of Code (TM)”</a> an annual event with Xmas-themed coding puzzles.</p>

<p>Our November 2023 event falls just two weeks before the start, so we’ll limber up by exploring a couple of past exercises.</p>

<p>We will work in groups to find a solution to the problems, you will need a laptop to Join, and have some experience of coding, but these are about problem solving.</p>

<p>This month at CodeCraft, we will be welcoming Pete Aitken, organiser of the ScotlandJS and ScotlandCSS and the fantastic initiative that is the Global Diversity CFP Day.
Peter will be giving a talk about fixing performance issues in his app.</p>

<p>Talk Abstract:</p>

<p>“Having left Queen, worldwide sell out stadium tours and albums behind, Freddie invites you to join him for a day in his new life as a software developer.
On this journey Freddie will be diving into a performance issue that is affecting a small number of high value customers to the extent the product is near unusable for them.
Find out what happens as Freddie attempts to resolve the issue while making a huge number of costume changes!”</p>

<p>But how true is this?</p>

<p>We’ll look at how a simple model can be expressed as a group of collaborating objects and then as a set of functions.</p>

<p>Which ones are easier to read, to reason about?</p>

<p>Which one would you prefer to work on?</p>

<p>What are the tradeoffs?</p>

<p>We’re bringing back an old favourite: July will be a Lean Coffee evening!</p>

<p>During the year, we can only cover so many topics. You, our community, often have questions you want answered, topics you want to discuss, or issues you feel you need to chat about. This is your chance!</p>

<p>Using a format called  <a href="http://leancoffee.org/" target="_blank">Lean Coffee</a>, we’ll give you the chance to come and talk about anything that you want. (Don’t worry if you don’t know Lean Coffee, it’s simple and we’ll teach you it at the start!)</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter whether you’re new to the industry or experienced, whether you want to ask a question about starting in IT or the ethics behind AI trade-offs, there’ll be the opportunity to engage with your peers on anything you like.</p>

<p>You don’t even need to bring a topic! Maybe you know something that’ll help answer a question for someone else, or maybe you’ll benefit by just listening in. If you’re interested in software, we’re sure you’ll take something useful away!</p>
