    <p class="lead">We are a <a href="/events/2017/11/craftsmanship-to-crafters">software crafters</a> meetup</p>

    <p>We discuss, demonstrate and debate how to write well-structured, malleable software</p>
    <p>We meet on the 3rd Thursday of every month</p>
    <p>We are a nomadic meetup: the location (within Glasgow) changes every month. We try to run in office spaces around the city, but occasionally meet in a pub; there is no expectation or pressure to drink alcohol when we do so.</p>
