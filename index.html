    <p class="lead">We are a <a href="/events/2017/11/craftsmanship-to-crafters">software crafters</a> meetup</p>

    <p>We discuss, demonstrate and debate how to write well-structured, malleable software</p>
    <p>We meet on the 3rd Thursday of every month</p>
    <p>We are a nomadic meetup: the location (within Glasgow) changes every month. We try to run in office spaces around the city, but occasionally meet in a pub; there is no expectation or pressure to drink alcohol when we do so.</p>

    <h1>CodeCraftConf is back!</h1>
    <div class="description">
      <p>No presentations: just guided conversations and workshops on the hottest topics in software development amongst your peers.</p>
      <!-- <p>Traditionally conferences feature a set of talks given by speakers, where you consume their thoughts and perhaps get a chance to ask a question at the end.</p>
      <p>This conference will be different.</p> -->
      <!-- <p>In small groups, we will have guided conversations around the latest topics of interest to software developers. We'll provide the guide, and you'll provide your thoughts. We will all learn from each other.</p> -->
