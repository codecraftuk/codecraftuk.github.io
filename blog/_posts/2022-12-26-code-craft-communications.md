Hello Everyone,

This is just a quick message to keep you all in the loop. 

Myself, Joe, Amelie and Kevin have met for our annual meeting and discussed what is coming in the next year. 

We want to make sure that CodeCraft keeps going for everyone who finds our meetup valuable just as we have since 2014. Whether it is for learning, advice, social or whatever folk find valuable, we want to ensure this space is open. 

With that in mind we will be going back to socials in 2023, weather and trains permitting. It will also be our 100th (!!!) event this year so I hope we can all celebrate together.

Our January event is The Multimedia Extravaganza ( the old book club) in which we share our favourite tech podcasts, books, courses etc which will then probably turn into a discussion about the best movies and TV shows by the end of the event. 
We are hoping to run it in person, again, weather and trains permitting. Official details will be out post christmas.

We found that Eventbrite emails work quite well...until we wanted to message folk without having an event. We would like to be able to communicate updates directly to folk and so we have a new mailing [list](https://codecraftuk.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=9a6623a33be5a429c40bae484&id=d83d6b4cda)
New events will be advertised here, alongside any updates from us. 

If you would like to help out in any capacity please let us know on contact@codecraftuk.org -  this can be helping out on the night, sponsorship, running a session ( we will help you with whatever you need), joining the codecraft team (we are actively looking for two more people)or even helping us with recommendations for improvements. We would really love some help!

See you next year,
Ewa and Team.
