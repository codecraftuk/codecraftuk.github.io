Our now annual tradition of getting together and discussing books has continued into its third year! It's not a book club in the traditional sense. Instead, we invite attendees to bring a book (or blog post, podcast, other media) that has influenced them. Everyone discusses their book in small groups, and gets to see a variety of recommendations.

Due to various reason (including the horrendous weather), it was a considerably quieter event than in previous years, but that let us get deeper into conversation around each topic.

For the second year in the row, we kick started our year with a book club event in which everyone brought in their favorite text/audio and discussed it. What was really interesting is that there were more podcasts than books this year, but technical books still held strongly.

We have composed a list of worthy entries (as deemed by the January attendees) for anyone's 2019 reading/listening resolutions.  The entries are as follows, in no particular order:   

#### Books

* "Humble Pi" by Matt Parker
* "Node.js: Beyond the Basics" by Samer Buna
* "Learn to Program" by Chris Pine
* "Remarkably Easy" by Danielle Macleod
* "Seven Languages in Seven Weeks" by Bruce Tate
* "Now The Chips Are Down" by Alison Gazzard
