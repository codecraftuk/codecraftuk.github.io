Our annual tradition of getting together and discussing books has continued into its fifth year!

It's not a book club in the traditional sense. Instead, we invite attendees to Bring-a-Book (or blog post, podcast, other media) that has influenced them.

This year, for the first time since 2020, we were able to get together in the Raven in Glasgow.

#### Books

 * "Team Topologies: Organizing Business and Technology Teams for Fast Flow" by Matthew Skelton, Manuel Pais, Edward Bauer
   Two people brought this book this year!
 * "Leadership Is Language: The Hidden Power of What You Say and What You Don't" by L. David Marquet
 * "Beautiful Code: Leading Programmers Explain How They Think" edited by Andy Oram and Greg Wilson
 * "The Mom Test" by Rob Fitzpatrick
 * "The Imposter Cure: Escape the Mind-Trap of Imposter Syndrome" by Dr Jessamy Hibberd, Zara Ramm, et al.
 * "Becoming a Better Programmer: A Handbook for People Who Care About Code" by Pete Goodliffe
 * "The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less" by Barry Schwartz
 * "Build What Matters: Delivering Key Outcomes with Vision-Led Product Management" by Ben Foster
 * "A Philosophy of Software Design" by John Ousterhout

It's always interesting seeing the recurring books that folks bring along, we've had a few repeats over the years, "Team Topologies" was making its third appearance, and "A Philosophy of Software Design" its second!
