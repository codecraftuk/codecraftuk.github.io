[Last week](/events/2020/06/tdd-is-my-shame), we had [Gary Fleming](https://twitter.com/garyfleming) give a talk on TDD called "TDD Is My Shame". During the talk and in the conversation afterwards, a number of books, courses, and blog posts were recommended. We've collected as many of them as we can remember below. We hope it helps!

* [TDD is My Shame slides](http://bit.ly/tdd-shame) - The slide deck for the talks (no notes)
* [TDD is my Shame repo](https://github.com/garyfleming/tdd-is-my-shame) - The GH repo that the talk is built from, which includes some notes.
* ["Practical Object Oriented Design"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Practical-Object-Oriented-Design-Ruby-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321721330) by [Sandi Metz](https://twitter.com/sandimetz) - Great book on issues of design and coupling that complement TDD well (even if you don't know Ruby, it's very readable)
* ["99 Bottles of OOP"](https://www.sandimetz.com/99bottles), also by Sandi Metz - More on OO design and TDD.
* ["The World's Best Intro to TDD"](https://online-training.jbrains.ca/p/wbitdd-01) by [J.B. Rainsberger](https://twitter.com/jbrains) - a course that was recommended to learn the basics of TDD.
* ["All The Little Things"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bZh5LMaSmE) - a great conference talk by, again, Sandi Metz where you see her refactoring a legacy codebase using tests.
* ["Testing Strategies in a Microservice Architecture"](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-testing/) by [Toby Clemson](https://github.com/tobyclemson) - a slide deck covering how to define tests with your team.
* [Test Sizes](https://testing.googleblog.com/2010/12/test-sizes.html) - Google testing blog post on how to define tests by size.
* [test && commit || revert](https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/test-commit-revert-870bbd756864) by [Kent Beck](https://twitter.com/KentBeck) - a bold new approach to test-driven code, sometimes called TCR, where if the tests pass when you run then, you automatically commit. If they fail, you revert any changes.
* [Roman Numerals Kata in TCR](https://github.com/joejag/tcr_roman_numerals/commits/master) - [Joe Wright](https://twitter.com/joe_jag) provides an example repo for a kata that was performed in a TCR style.
* [Global Day of Coderetreat](https://www.coderetreat.org/) - a global event where people in cities around the world deliberately pratice using fundamental design principles, like TDD.
