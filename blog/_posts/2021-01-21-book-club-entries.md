Our annual tradition of getting together and discussing books has continued into its fourth year! It's not a book club in the traditional sense. Instead, we invite attendees to bring a book (or blog post, podcast, other media) that has influenced them.

This year we ran online, and the number of people around meant it was good to discuss topics as a single group. The entries are as follows, in no particular order.
