Our annual tradition of getting together and discussing books has continued into its fourth year! It's not a book club in the traditional sense. Instead, we invite attendees to Bring-a-Book (or blog post, podcast, other media) that has influenced them.

This year we ran it online again, and the number of people around meant it was good to discuss topics as a single group. The entries are as follows, in no particular order.
