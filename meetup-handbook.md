## How we run CodeCraft

CodeCraft runs once every month, taking a break in December (for Christmas) and September (for the conference).

We usually alternate between three formats:

 * A [Lean Coffee](http://leancoffee.org/)
 * A [Guided Conversation](https://guidedconversations.org/)
 * A Workshop

We kick-off events at 6 pm and try to have them finishing around 8:45 pm. The venue we choose cannot be a pub, as we don't want to dissuade between from attending who don't like being around environments where alcohol is typical.

We have a [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct) which the event organisers are responsible for promoting and enforcing.

We aim to have the venue, format and event description created for a meetup for the first day of the month on which the event will run (i.e. The October event will be published on the 1st October).

## Events

CodeCraft organisers have two meetings that we run to coordinate our actions:

* A quarterly planning meeting (January, April and October)
* An annual general meeting (January)

## The quarterly planning meeting

Once a quarter, we physically meet up to discuss the next three events we intend to run. We expect there to be a lead and a secondary person nominated for each month. The event runners get to decide where and how to run that event without requiring consent from the other members.

For example, in January 2019, we agreed the following three events:

* February: Lean Coffee (Ewa and Keith) at JP Morgan
* March: Workshop (Joe and Keith) at SkyScanner
* April: Guided Conversation (Gary and Amélie) at Morgan Stanley

We like to rotate which venue we use, so we don't wear out our welcome. We maintain a list of potential venues and our contact their in our Trello board.

We find the quarterly planning to be beneficial as it allows us to meet up as a group outside of the pressures of running an event. Having the next three months planned out reduces the anxiety of the group as we don't have to rush to plan a meetup at the end of each month.

## The annual general meeting

We meet up once a year to review the year, how we operate and look to see if there are any new goals which we want to focus on for the next year.

Folks who have been helping out for over a year are considered to become full board members at the annual general meeting. They have been:

* 2018: Ewa Grabowiecka
* 2016: Caroline Kirkhope
* 2015: Keith Kirkhope (Secretary)
* 2014: Gary Fleming (President), Joe Wright (Treasuer)

## Tools

CodeCraft has a [Slack group](http://mgdm.slack.com) with two channels, one for the general chat and meetup arrangements, the other for the conference. The majority of meetup co-ordination happens on Slack.

To support us, we also have a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/5nKBgqdU/thingstodo) we use to remind us of tasks that we want to complete.

To promote our meetup we use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/codecraftuk) and [EventBrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/codecraft-17411376408)

## Who is involved

Our board is made up of:

 * Gary Fleming (President)
 * Joe Wright (Treasurer)
 * Keith Harrison (Secretary)
 * Caroline Kirkhope
 * Ewa Grabowiecka

The president chairs the annual meeting and helps us resolve split decisions about how we can progress as a group.

We have around £3,000 coming in and out of our bank account each year, mainly due to the September conference. The treasurer is responsible for making sure we don't plan to overspend on our events and conference.

The secretary takes minutes at the formal meetings and keeps the constitution up to date.
