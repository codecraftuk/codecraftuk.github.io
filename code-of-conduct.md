Code Craft is an event intended for education, networking, and community. To ensure it is a welcoming and friendly environment for all, attendees, speakers, organisers, and volunteers at any Code Craft meetup are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the meetup and meetup-related social events.

Code Craft is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meetup experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of meetup participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for our meetup, including the content of talks. Code Craft participants violating these rules may be asked to leave at the discretion of the meetup organisers.

## The Longer Version
Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. We do not tolerate Sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the meetup organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact one of the organisers immediately.

Code Craft organisers will be happy to help participants contact security or police, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the meetup. We value your attendance.

Additionally, this Code of Conduct may change from time to time. We will endeavour to make it known when this happens through our normal public communication channels.
