## Ground Rules

We want the discussion to be as interesting, useful and productive as possible. Without some rules in place we risk the conversations going off topic and people feeling attacked. To get the most out of the event we’d ask everyone to comply with the following rules:

* No arguments directed at people – only at ideas and opinions.  Disagreement should be respectful.
* Listen to the whole of others’ thoughts – actually listen, rather than just running over your own response in your head.
* Respect the group’s time.  Try to keep your comments reasonably short and to the point, so that others have a chance to respond.
* Consider all comments seriously, and try to evaluate them fairly.  Others’ ideas and comments may change your mind, or vice versa: it’s important to be open to that.
* If someone disagrees with you then evaluate both positions, and only continue to argue for yours if you continue to believe it’s right. Our discussions are about learning, so try to be open to disagreement rather than defensive.
* Everyone is responsible for following the ground rules, and should help uphold them where they feel able to do so. The organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup.

## Harassment-free meetup

CodeCraft is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meetup experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of meetup participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for our meetup, including the content of talks. CodeCraft participants violating these rules may be asked to leave at the discretion of the meetup organisers.

Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. We do not tolerate Sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the meetup organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact one of the organisers immediately.

CodeCraft organisers will be happy to help participants contact security or police, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the meetup. We value your attendance.

Additionally, this Code of Conduct may change from time to time. We will endeavour to make it known when this happens through our normal public communication channels.
