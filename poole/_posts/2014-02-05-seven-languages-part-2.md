title: Seven Languages in Seven Weeks, Part 2
---

For our second Seven Languages in Seven Weeks event, we'll be covering the remaining four languages: Scala, Erlang, Clojure and Haskell. We are encouraging programmers in and around Glasgow to read the excellent book, [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/193435659X/), and follow-up by discussing what you learn with your peers.

It doesn't matter if you didn't make it to the first event (covering Ruby, Prolog and IO) or whether you have time to do all four chapters of the book: cover the languages you can with the time you have, and come and join the discussion regardless of your level of experience.

We encourage you to tackle the languages in any order, and bring along any examples you make along the way for further discussion.
