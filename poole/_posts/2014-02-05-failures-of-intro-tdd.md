title: The Failures of Intro to TDD
---

As our first event in our new monthly slot (3rd Thursday of each month), we intend to get hands-on with an exploration of TDD. In his recent blog post, [The Failures of "Intro to TDD"](http://blog.testdouble.com/posts/2014-01-25-the-failures-of-intro-to-tdd.html), [Justin Searls](https://twitter.com/searls) makes the case that TDD is generally taught poorly, and provides a different way of exploring your design through tests.

To see how well it works, we're going to be doing some hands-on practice (a kata or two) with classic TDD, London-School TDD and TDD reductionism (as described by Searls). So bring along a laptop if you have one handy, and we'll get coding. If you don't, don't worry, we should have enough between us to cover everyone.
