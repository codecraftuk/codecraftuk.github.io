<p>Looking for a new coding challenge for the New Year? Trying to pick up some new skills? Take the CodeCraft Seven Languages in Seven Weeks challenge.</p>

<p>For our first events, we are encouraging programmers in and around Glasgow to read the excellent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/193435659X/">Seven Languages in Seven Weeks</a>, and follow-up by discussing what you learn with your peers.</p>

<p>Our first event, on the <strong>4th February at 7pm</strong>, will be dedicated to the first 3 languages in the book (Ruby, Prolog and IO), with the rest covered at the next event in March.</p>

<p>While we hope you should have plenty of time to pick-up a copy of the book and study all three languages for February, we&#39;d like to hear from you regardless of how much you manage to get through or your level of experience.</p>
