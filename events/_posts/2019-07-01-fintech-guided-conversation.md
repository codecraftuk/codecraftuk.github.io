For our July event weâ€™re teaming up with Scottish Fintech to discuss all things Fintech. This will be in our usual format of [Guided Conversations](http://guidedconversations.org/). The conversation will cover concepts of fintech, how it is changing the finance industry and how it can help people be more financially aware. We will also dive into the tech on fintech, and try to uncover what challenges the industry might face.

Guided conversations are a friendly way to have a structured yet lightweight discussion around a topic. A guide will make sure we stay on track, and offer questions to spark the conversation. It doesn't matter if you're new to the industry, or whether your're experienced, you may be able to ask just the right questions to unlock key insights for others, whilst listening in and learning for yourself. We'll explain the format and make sure everyone keeps up with the discussion.
