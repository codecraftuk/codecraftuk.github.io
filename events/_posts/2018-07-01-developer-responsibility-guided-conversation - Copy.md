FREE TICKET REQUIRED!

For our July event, we're going to have a [Guided Conversation](http://guidedconversations.org/) about Developer Responsibility.

Most developers know they have responsibilites: in their codebases, to their teams, to their organisations, and to the world at large. Where exactly do the lines lie? To what extent are developer's responsible for their actions?

We'll discuss everything from who is responsible for testing of our codebases, to our responsibilities to our community in seeking to redress gender imbalances and diversity challenges.

It doesn't matter if you're new to the industry, or whether your're experienced, you may be able to ask just the right questions to unlock key insights for others, whilst listening in and learning for yourself. We'll explain the format ([Guided Conversations](http://guidedconversations.org/)), and make sure everyone keeps up with the discussion.
