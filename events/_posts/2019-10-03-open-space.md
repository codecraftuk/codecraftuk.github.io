We’re trialling a different format for this month’s event: open-spacing it! In other words, we are inviting you to come with:

* a problem you need to solve
* a feature you want to implement
* a kata you wish to run through
* a language/tool you are passionate about and would like to share
* a language/tool you are curious about and would like to practice
* or an open mind to pair with someone on something new

The actual topics will be decided on the day: we will start with a marketplace for people to share their ideas and organise ourselves around the topics of interest.
