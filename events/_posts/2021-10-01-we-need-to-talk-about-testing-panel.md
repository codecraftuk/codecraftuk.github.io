For our October event, we will be live interviewing a panel of testing experts about the exciting topics in the testing right now.

We will explore topics such as:

- What "should be" the human part of software testing, and what should be automated?
- In 2021, is the testing pyramid considered harmful?
- Observability communities suggest that we invest too much in testing pre-production. Can we move more testing to production?

Our panel includes:

- [Alaine Miller](https://twitter.com/miller_alaine) - Software Engineer (Aggregated Metadata Platform) [BBC](https://twitter.com/bbc)
- [Cassandra H. Leung](https://twitter.com/Tweet_Cassandra) - Quality Engineer and Product Owner at [Ada Health](https://twitter.com/adahealth)
- [Richard Bradshaw](https://twitter.com/FriendlyTester) - BossBoss at [Ministry of Testing](https://twitter.com/ministryoftest)
- [Rob Meaney](https://twitter.com/RobMeaney) - Director Of Engineering at [Glofox](https://twitter.com/weareglofox)

We are delighted with this line-up, and we hope to see you there too.
