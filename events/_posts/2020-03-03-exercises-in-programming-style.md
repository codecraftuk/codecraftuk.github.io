For our March event, we'll be looking at how simple constraints shape the code we write.

From only allowing use of the "standard library" of your library, to pipelining the results of functions, by restricting the tools we can use to write our code, we can learn about the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches.

Based on the book [Exercises in Programming Style](https://www.crcpress.com/Exercises-in-Programming-Style/Lopes/p/book/9781482227376) we'll take a simple problem, and see how changing the rules around implementing it can change how you think about the solution.

Everybody welcome, beginners and experienced coders alike, there's no need to read the book in advance.
