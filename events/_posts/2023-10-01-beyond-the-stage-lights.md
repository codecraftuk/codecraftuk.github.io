This month at CodeCraft, we will be welcoming Pete Aitken, organiser of the ScotlandJS and ScotlandCSS and the fantastic initiative that is the Global Diversity CFP Day.
Peter will be giving a talk about fixing performance issues in his app.

Talk Abstract:

"Having left Queen, worldwide sell out stadium tours and albums behind, Freddie invites you to join him for a day in his new life as a software developer.
On this journey Freddie will be diving into a performance issue that is affecting a small number of high value customers to the extent the product is near unusable for them.
Find out what happens as Freddie attempts to resolve the issue while making a huge number of costume changes!"
