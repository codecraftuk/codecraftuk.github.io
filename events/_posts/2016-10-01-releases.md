title: "Releases: A Guided Conversation"
---

For our October event, we'll be running a <a href="http://guidedconversations.org/">Guided Conversation</a> about Releases and Deployment.

We spend a lot of time thinking and talking about code, trying to produce the best software that we can. At some point, it needs to go live, but how do we know that the release has worked, will continue to work, and does what we expect? 

Release and deployment can be difficult to get right, especially as we move further in the direction of Continuous Delivery and Deployment. The modern technologist needs to understand a wider range of questions than ever before, so why not discuss them with us?

Come along and join in, or simply listen, with a group of your peers having a conversation on an important topic.
