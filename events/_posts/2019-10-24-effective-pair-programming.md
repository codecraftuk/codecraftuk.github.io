For our last event of the year, we'll be running a workshop on how to be effective while pair programming.

You will learn:

* The different styles of pair programming and the importance of switching
* How to work with people of different levels and roles

Don't worry if you've never pair programmed before. We'll be pairing people up to make sure every pair has what they need.

The session will be theory and exercises, finishing with a real pair programming exercise. Please bring along your laptops!
