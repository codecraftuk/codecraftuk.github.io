title: Lean Coffee
description: For our May event, we're going to have a Lean Coffee session. 6.30pm, Thursday 17th May, Incremental Group.

After a run of events involving book clubs and conversations on AI, we've decided that for our May event we're going to give the community an opportunity to discuss the topics that matter most to them. That's right: Lean Coffee is back.

Rather than us dictate a topic, bring along whatever questions you want answered, topics you want to discuss, and issues you feel the need to chat about. We'll use the Lean Coffee format to cover the things that you, the attendees, want to get into the most.

It doesn't matter whether you're new to the industry or experienced, whether you want to ask a question about starting in IT or the ethics behind AI trade-offs, there'll be the opportunity to engage with your peers on anything you like.

It doesn't matter if you don't have a topic, you may be able to provide valuable perspective for others, or learn something new by just listening. It also doesn't matter if you don't know the Lean Coffee format, it's simple and we'll take the time to explain it before we get started.
