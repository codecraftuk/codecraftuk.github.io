We'll hear from [Dan Abel](https://twitter.com/twicezer0) about a different way to look at our tests:

Test automation choices are often driven by the test pyramid model. The way we build and run software has changed since that model was popularised. We have access to new tools and testing in production is now a feature, not a failure.

When building my microservices I now model my tests on an ice cream sandwich  - I'll tell you how and why that works for me and maybe it could be a great pattern for you.

We'll follow up the presentation by a discussion (either as one group, or break into smaller groups, depending on how many people are around).
