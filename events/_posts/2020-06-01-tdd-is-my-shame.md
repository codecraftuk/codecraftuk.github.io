In this months codecraft we are trying something new - an interactive talk. Gary will be presenting his talk "TDD is my shame" and making it interactive. 

**Abstract**: 

 "I don't do as much Test-Driven Development as I should; it's my shame."

The more time I spend at recent development conferences, the more I see this sentiment echoed. Developers get the impression that they should do TDD, but they don't.
Sometimes they don't know how to do it effectively, so it ends up a mess. Sometimes they don't know when they should do it, so it ends up being overapplied. Sometimes they don't really know what it is, so they end up treating it in odd ways.

In this talk, you'll get answers for all of the above and more. You'll understand TDD better, you'll understand how to be more effective, and you'll learn to let go of that little voice that says you should do more.
