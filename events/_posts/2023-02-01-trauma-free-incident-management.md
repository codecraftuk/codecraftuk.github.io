This month we are having an online meetup with Mårten, who will talk us through his process of incident management:

As a developer, incidents are unavoidable. And the intense anxiety that they cause can feel as though they have taken years off of your life. But it doesn’t have to be that way. By employing a lightweight and proven process, incidents can instead be events with a reasonable level of stress. With this process, incidents can even improve team spirit, build trust in the organization, and lead to improvements.

Come and join :) 


### Code of conduct 

We want everyone to feel welcome at our events, therefore we have a code of conduct to make sure we are very clear in what type of behaviour we tolerate at our events.
