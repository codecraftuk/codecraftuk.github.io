Embark on a coding adventure like never before! Join us for an uplifting virtual event where you'll step into the shoes of a software engineer tasked with programming an elevator system using JavaScript. Get ready to roll up your sleeves and dive deep into the world of programming as you tackle real-life challenges in elevator logic. From defining floor behaviour to optimizing passenger flow, this hands-on experience will put your JavaScript skills to the test.

### Do I need to know Javascript already?

No, we will be working in small groups. This session is designed for folks who know Javascript and those that don't.

### Do I need to install anything before the event?

No. We will be using an online website to run the simulation.

### Code of conduct

We want everyone to feel welcome at our events, therefore we have a code of conduct to make sure we are very clear in what type of behaviour we tolerate at our events. [Read it here](https://www.codecraftuk.org/code-of-conduct.html)
