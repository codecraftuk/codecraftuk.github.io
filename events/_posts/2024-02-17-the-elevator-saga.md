### Do I need to know Javascript already?

No, we will be working in small groups. This session is designed for folks who know Javascript and those that don't.

### Do I need to install anything before the event?

No. We will be using an online website to run the simulation.

### Code of conduct

We want everyone to feel welcome at our events, therefore we have a code of conduct to make sure we are very clear in what type of behaviour we tolerate at our events. [Read it here](https://www.codecraftuk.org/code-of-conduct.html)
