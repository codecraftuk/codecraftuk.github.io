Code Smells are hints of an underlying problem in our code. In this session, we will explore the vocabulary for talking about identifying refactoring opportunities.

It's helpful to have a vocabulary for talking about refactoring. It will help you to communicate when doing strong-style pairing or mob programming. Code smells are perhaps a less-known concept than refactoring, and knowing these names will also help you to speak about code and identify targets for refactoring. In this session, we'll talk about what a code smell is and learn the names of some common ones.

Once we've explored smells, we'll have a short lean coffee session to discuss other topics to do with code quality.

**Agenda**

- Learn what code smells are
- Exercise: Find code smells
- Lean Coffee on the topic of code quality
