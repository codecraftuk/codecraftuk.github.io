This month we will be diving into Test Driven Development (TDD) - a practice where we write tests first, and code after, in order to implement a feature. 

It may sound counterintuitive at first, but with practice, it becomes a powerful strategy to scale your codebase quickly, with fewer bugs. 

So come along, **with your laptop** and we will learn together. We will be working through a code kata to implement this methodology. 

Don’t worry about which language we will use or how much experience you had with testing frameworks.  We will be on hand to help, whether it is Java, C#, JS, C#, Go, Python ( and possibly others) .

We are generously hosted by JP Morgan, who will be providing space, food and drink.

**Agenda**
- Short intro into Test Driven Development
- Hands on exercise
- We hope to see you soon!

### Code of conduct 

We want everyone to feel welcome at our events, therefore we have a code of conduct to make sure we are very clear in what type of behaviour we tolerate at our events.
