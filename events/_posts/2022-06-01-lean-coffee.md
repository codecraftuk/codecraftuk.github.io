We’re bringing back an old favourite: June will be a Lean Coffee evening!

Using a format called Lean Coffee, we’ll give you the chance to come and talk about anything that you want. (Don’t worry if you don’t know Lean Coffee, it’s simple and we’ll teach you it at the start!)

It doesn’t matter whether you’re new to the industry or experienced, whether you want to ask a question about starting in IT or the ethics behind AI trade-offs, there’ll be the opportunity to engage with your peers on anything you like.

You don’t even need to bring a topic! Maybe you know something that’ll help answer a question for someone else, or maybe you’ll benefit by just listening in. If you’re interested in software, we’re sure you’ll take something useful away!

We are hosted this time by Global Radio and Pizza and drink is kindly provided by Fraser Merrifield

### Code of conduct 
We want everyone to feel welcome at our events, therefore we have a code of conduct to make sure we are very clear in what type of behaviour we tolerate at our events.
[Read it here](https://www.codecraftuk.org/code-of-conduct.html)

### Covid safety measures

This is our Second in-person event since 2020. We want to run a minimal risk event, which requires that we all adhere to additional measures (listed below) during the event.

Also note: we are meeting in a location where other folks will be.

**CodeCraft** will:

- Provide hand sanitiser
- Disinfect tables before the event starts

The **attendee** will:

- Not attend if they have COVID-19 symptoms on the day of the event
- Cover their nose and mouth with a mask while moving around the building
- Leave if asked to by an organiser who suspects they have COVID-19 symptoms
- If they test positive for COVID-19 in the days after, inform the CodeCraft organisers
