Performance, Accessibility, Scalability have been the target of our industry for so long now. Is it time that our impact on the climate is assessed as part of our key metrics?

In this months CodeCraft we will come together to discuss Software, Developers and Climate Change.

Topics we will cover include:

- Inequality and innovation
- Actions we could take as developers
- Company culture around Climate Change

You don't need to already be an expert in this field, come along and share what you know.

We will be in our usual format of [Guided Conversations](http://guidedconversations.org/).

Guided conversations are a friendly way to have a structured yet lightweight discussion around a topic. A guide will ensure we stay on track and offer questions to spark the conversation. It doesn't matter if you're new to the industry or whether you're experienced; you may be able to ask just the right questions to unlock critical insights for others whilst listening in and learning for yourself. We'll explain the format and ensure everyone keeps up with the discussion.
