For April's event, we're going to be thinking about modelling our software: taking a design that is light and abstract, and adding layers of detail to it to see how that affects the design.

How does adding detail to a design make it more realistic? Conversely, how does it make it harder to work with? Does this affect how we test it?

We'll be doing this via a lightweight coding exercise, either in small groups or as a mob. You don't need to be an expert to participate: we'll make sure you're teamed up with enough people.
