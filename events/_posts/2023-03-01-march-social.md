This month we're getting together for a social meetup.

 * Are you working from home?
 * Are you working in a hybrid model?

We're meeting up in the Raven for a bit of chat.

What are you working on that's interesting?
What are you learning?

### Code of conduct 

We want everyone to feel welcome at our events, therefore we have a code of conduct to make sure we are very clear in what type of behaviour we tolerate at our events.
