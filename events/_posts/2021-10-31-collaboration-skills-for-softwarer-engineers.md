As the "lone coder" stereotype breaks down and splinters more and more in today's highly collaborative software engineering teams, what are the essential skills required to prosper? This guided conversation will explore two axes of "scale" in software engineering, and try to highlight the skills, techniques, and practices that we rely on as teams and as individuals working together in teams.

This will be in our usual format of [Guided Conversations](http://guidedconversations.org/). The conversation will cover how collaboration works, what the essential skills are, and how they change with more and more people. We'll be guided by Per Hammer.

Guided conversations are a friendly way to have a structured yet lightweight discussion around a topic. A guide will make sure we stay on track, and offer questions to spark the conversation. It doesn't matter if you're new to the industry, or whether you're experienced, you may be able to ask just the right questions to unlock key insights for others, whilst listening in and learning for yourself. We'll explain the format and make sure everyone keeps up with the discussion.
