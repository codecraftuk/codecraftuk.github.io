This month, we have chosen to mark that it's been a year + since the renewed hightlight that Black Lives Matter ([statement & resources](/blog/2020/06/black-lives-matter)).

And so, we invite folks to a [Guided Conversation](http://guidedconversations.org/) on our respective anti-racism practices in the tech industry.

We will give an introduction to what anti-racism is, and how it differs from not being racist.

The actual question set will be finalised during the coming weeks, and we expect to discuss together topics such as:
<ul>
 <li>what we have tried so far</li>
 <li>how we are measuring our impact</li>
 <li>what changes we are seeing - or not yet seeing</li>
 <li>what we are planning to try next</li>
</ul>

The format of the event means that there will be space for everybody to speak, and you can also come to listen.

We also recognise anti-racism is a journey and we welcome people at the stage they're currently at.
