We're bringing back an old favourite: July will be a Lean Coffee evening!

During the year, we can only cover so many topics. You, our community, often have questions you want answered, topics you want to discuss, or issues you feel you need to chat about. This is your chance!

Using a format called  <a href="http://leancoffee.org/" target="_blank">Lean Coffee</a>, we'll give you the chance to come and talk about anything that you want. (Don't worry if you don't know Lean Coffee, it's simple and we'll teach you it at the start!)

It doesn't matter whether you're new to the industry or experienced, whether you want to ask a question about starting in IT or the ethics behind AI trade-offs, there'll be the opportunity to engage with your peers on anything you like.

You don't even need to bring a topic! Maybe you know something that'll help answer a question for someone else, or maybe you'll benefit by just listening in. If you're interested in software, we're sure you'll take something useful away!

### Code of conduct 

We want everyone to feel welcome at our events, therefore we have a code of conduct to make sure we are very clear in what type of behaviour we tolerate at our events.
