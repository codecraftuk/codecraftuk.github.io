For our November event, we're going to have a [Guided Conversation](http://guidedconversations.org/) about Architecting Teams.

Does your team have a goal? Do you know how to work together effectively? Let's talk about how we create and work within teams to deliver the best software that we can. Let's think about how we can improve the ways in which we work together to produce even better results and, more importantly, happier people.

Even if you're relatively new and have rarely worked on a team, you can still learn from the others, while asking questions that the more experienced participants might miss. We'll explain the format ([Guided Conversations](http://guidedconversations.org/)), and make sure everyone keeps up with the discussion.
