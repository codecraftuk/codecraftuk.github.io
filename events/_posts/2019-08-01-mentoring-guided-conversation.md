August is a month when graduates usually join companies, which makes it a great time to think about mentoring. But we don't only mentor graduates! Mentoring happens at every level, and it does not always have to work top-down. Having a mentor can usually help with career progression (for both mentee and mentor) but those relationships don't always work out.

This will be in our usual format of [Guided Conversations](http://guidedconversations.org/). The conversation will cover what mentoring is, different types and styles of mentoring, how to mentor effectively, and what the benefits/downfalls are amongst other important questions.

Guided conversations are a friendly way to have a structured yet lightweight discussion around a topic. A guide will make sure we stay on track, and offer questions to spark the conversation. It doesn't matter if you're new to the industry, or whether you're experienced, you may be able to ask just the right questions to unlock key insights for others, whilst listening in and learning for yourself. We'll explain the format and make sure everyone keeps up with the discussion.
