Welcome to 2020! Want to get better at Pair Programming? Let us help you communicate more effectively while pairing.

For our January event, we'll be working on the link between being good at pair programming, and being able to communicate in a helpful way.

We'll help you to:

* See why communicating clearly will make you a better coder, and how to do that with a pair.
* Demonstrating several different communication styles.
* Practicing Pairing with a simple exercise.

Don't worry if you've never pair programmed before. We'll be pairing people up to make sure every pair has what they need.

The session will be theory and exercises, finishing with a real pair programming exercise. Please bring along your laptops! (We'll have some spare if you can't bring one, but bring one if you can)
