For our March event, we're going to do something a little bit different and focus on Interviews.  The plan is to discuss various interview techniques and people's experiences both good and bad and try to come up with some practices and principles for what makes a good interview process, both from the point of view of the interviewer and the interviewee.  

It doesn't matter if you have little experience of interviews or have years of experience of actually interviewing people everyone will be able to contribute and as always learn from their peers!
