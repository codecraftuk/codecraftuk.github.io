For our June event, we’re doing a Pair Programming and TDD exercise called the [Ping Pong Pattern](http://wiki.c2.com/?PairProgrammingPingPongPattern).

We’ll work through a programming exercise in pairs using the pattern and then discuss how we found the process.

Don’t worry if you’ve never pair programmed or done TDD before. We’ll be pairing people up to make sure every pair has at least one person who’s done both.

Please bring along your laptops!

# The Exercise

## Pair Programming Ping Pong Pattern

In pairs:

 * A writes a new test and sees that it fails.
 * B implements the code needed to pass the test.
 * B writes the next test and sees that it fails.
 * A implements the code needed to pass the test.

And so on. Refactoring is done whenever the need arises by whoever is driving.

## The Problem - Number Plate Decoder
Given a number plate:

1. Calculate the cars age
2. Output the local mnemonic (just for Scotland)
3. Output the DVLA office (just for Scotland)
4. Validate the three letter sequence
5. Output local mnemonics for all areas and determine if mnemonics is valid
6. Output DVLA offices for all areas and determine if mnemonics is valid
