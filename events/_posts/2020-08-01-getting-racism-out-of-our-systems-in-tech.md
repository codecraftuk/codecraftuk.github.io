This month, we partner with [Gillian Neish](http://neishtraining.com/about.html) for a workshop to understand racism, and what we can each do about it.

We will have the opportunity to:
* Explore the systematic nature of racism and its impact on relationships
* Discuss the implications for working in tech
* Consider our own ’next steps’ to create an inclusive environment

There will be a short video (about 20mins) to watch before the event. We will email the details a week before the event.

Come and join us to discover or improve your anti-racism practices.
