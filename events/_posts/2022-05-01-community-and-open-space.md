For May's event, we are planning to meet in person. In the future, we will keep doing either remote or in-person events.

This month we will have the opportunity to both chat to folks informally, and also participate in an open space (which is pretty informal too!). It will be easy to move between the two as the evening progresses.

For the open space: the agenda will be built on the day by whoever joins. The sort of topics we sometimes discuss are:

* a problem you need to solve
* a feature you want to implement
* a kata you wish to run through
* a language/tool you are passionate about and would like to share
* a language/tool you are curious about and would like to practice
* or an open mind to pair with someone on something new

We'll start the meetup with a marketplace for people to share their ideas and organise ourselves around the topics of interest.


### Covid safety measures

This is our first in-person event since 2020. We want to run a minimal risk event, which requires that we all adhere to additional measures (listed below) during the event.

Also note: we are meeting in a location where other folks will be.

**CodeCraft** will:

- Provide hand sanitiser
- Disinfect tables before the event starts
- Organise the event into smaller groups to minimise contacts

The **attendee** will:

- Not attend if they have COVID-19 symptoms on the day of the event
- Cover their nose and mouth with a mask while moving around the building
- Leave if asked to by an organiser who suspects they have COVID-19 symptoms
- If they test positive for COVID-19 in the days after, inform the CodeCraft organisers
