How can we make meetings that are more fruitful, collaborative and lively, especially now that most are happening online?

For our June event, we cover a couple of [Liberating Structures](https://www.liberatingstructures.com): micro-structures that enhance relational coordination and trust between people. Our focus is on how to run these well online. No prior knowledge of the structures is necessary.

We will practice each structure in turn: explain how the structure works, have a warm-up round, tweak instructions if necessary then have a proper round, and lastly reflect on how it went.
