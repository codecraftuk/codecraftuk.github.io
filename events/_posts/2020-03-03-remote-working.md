For our March event, we'll be looking at hosting an online guided conversation about Remote Working. 

More and more people are being asked to work remotely which has its own unique challenges in terms of tooling, communication and engagement. On the call we will be discussing these issues and sharing our experiences!

We will run the call at 6 30pm. It will consist of 2 x 45 min sessions with a 15 min break in the middle. We will be using zoom for this call.

We would also really appreciate it if you muted your mic at the start of the call so we do not get overwhelmed with noise!
