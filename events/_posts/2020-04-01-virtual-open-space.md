Following on from last months remote meetup. We are running another online-only event based around the [Open Space format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology)

The agenda will be built on the day by whoever turns up. The sort of topics we'd like to discuss are:

* a problem you need to solve
* a feature you want to implement
* a kata you wish to run through
* a language/tool you are passionate about and would like to share
* a language/tool you are curious about and would like to practice
* or an open mind to pair with someone on something new

We'll start the meetup with a marketplace for people to share their ideas and organise ourselves around the topics of interest.
