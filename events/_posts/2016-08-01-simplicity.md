title: "Simplicity: A Guided Conversation"
---

For our August event, we'll be running a <a href="http://guidedconversations.org/">Guided Conversation</a> entitled, "Simplicity".

Back in April, we tackled the idea of Simplicity by working in small groups looking at the various attempts to codify simplicity, and attempting to come up with our own rules.

It's time to revisit the topic as part of a bigger conversation, as we dedicate an entire evening to discussing this fundamental topic of software craftsmanship. While we won't release the exact set beforehand, you can expect a wide-range of thought-provoking questions taking us all over the topic. 

Come along and join in, or simply listen, with a group of your peers having a conversation on an important topic.
