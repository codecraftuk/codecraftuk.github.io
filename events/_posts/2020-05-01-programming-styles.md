As we're likely to still be in lockdown, we are running another online-only event based around the book [Exercises in Programming Style](https://www.routledge.com/Exercises-in-Programming-Style/Lopes/p/book/9781482227376).

We'll look at how constraints influence the design of software.

A simple problem like counting the frequency of words in a file can be written in many different ways, and by applying some rules to limit how you think about the problem, what might seem like a simple task can be transformed into a learning experience.

No knowledge of the book is required, but this is a programming exercise, so you'll need to have a development environment installed in the language of your choice.
