"41% of employees are considering leaving their current employer this year and 46% say theyâ€™re likely to move because they can now work remotely." - [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/hybrid-work)

The pandemic has changed the day to day life of software developers. We are no longer limited to jobs near where we live. How will this affect us going into 2022? What will we do differently as organisations, and how will this affect our job prospects?

We will be in our usual format of [Guided Conversations](http://guidedconversations.org/). The conversation will cover why the great resignation is happening, how it affects tech, and how it might change how we hire and retain colleagues. We will then focus on interviewing in a hybrid and remote world.

Guided conversations are a friendly way to have a structured yet lightweight discussion around a topic. A guide will ensure we stay on track and offer questions to spark the conversation. It doesn't matter if you're new to the industry or whether you're experienced; you may be able to ask just the right questions to unlock critical insights for others whilst listening in and learning for yourself. We'll explain the format and ensure everyone keeps up with the discussion.
