We've all heard of design patterns but what does it look like to use them in real projects? 

Join us on this interactive tour into design patterns where we'll discuss what design patterns are and where they're used in real life. And of course no discussion on design patterns would be complete without a talking about the Gang of Four and how they fit into all this.
No knowledge of design patterns are necessary to attend, although you may find you know more about design patterns than you thought!
