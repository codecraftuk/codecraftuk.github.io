For our August event, we will be refactoring code written by a colleague. This exercise is taken from [Emily Bache's Kata list](https://github.com/emilybache)

The aim of this kata is to improve the already existing code for the Tennis Society who requested software to keep score of their tennis matches. 

The goal of this exercise is to encourage you to consider how domain knowlege can help in undertstanding code, how tests you write help others as much as you and some good tips for writing better quality code.

No matter the skill level or language choice we welcome everyone!

The exercise will be conducted in pairs/teams, but if you would like to do work on it by yourself that's good with us too.
