FREE TICKET REQUIRED!

For our April event, we're going to have a [Guided Conversation](http://guidedconversations.org/) about Technical Excellence, with [Amélie Cornélis](https://twitter.com/AmelieCornelis).

Excellence at anything is a journey rather than a destination. In technology, the field is vast and ever expanding: the path can feel never ending.
So let's talk about practical stepping stones that can help along the way to technical excellence, such as deliberate practice (targeted exercises, code retreats), reflecting with your peers (both in and outside of work), self-awareness (how do *you* best learn), etc.

It doesn't matter if you're new to the industry, or whether your're experienced, you may be able to ask just the right questions to unlock key insights for others, whilst listening in and learning for yourself. We'll explain the format ([Guided Conversations](http://guidedconversations.org/)), and make sure everyone keeps up with the discussion.
