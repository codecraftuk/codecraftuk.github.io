How often have you had to read an unfamiliar codebase?

We read code many, many times more than we write it, but we spend most of our
time learning to write the code, and rarely spend the time to think about how we
can improve our understanding of pre-existing code.

Join us as we dig into codebases and find out how to identify the key elements
of previously unknown source, identify patterns in the code, and dive into
understanding how the internals of code we use is written.

Doing this will help you see how other folks write code, help you pick up a
project faster, debug issues in dependencies, and improve the code you write.
