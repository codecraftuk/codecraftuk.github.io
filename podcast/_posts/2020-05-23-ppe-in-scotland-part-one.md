In this two-parter, we will be interviewing tech people who have changed their focus to making PPE, specifically face shields, for those who need it most. 

Sarah Naseer and Roisin Arnold are a dream team based in Glasgow. In this episode they are talking about their journey of design and improvement of the shields, making custom guillotines and the demand for their products.
