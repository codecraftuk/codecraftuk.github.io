title: "CodeCraft Book Club Entries"
description: Names of texts/others discussed at the January event.
---
For the second year in the row, we kick started our year with a book club event in which everyone brought in their favorite text/audio and discussed it. What was really interesting is that there were more podcasts than books this year, but technical books still held strongly.

 We have composed a list of worthy entries (as deemed by the January attendees) for anyone's 2019 reading/listening resolutions.  The entries are as follows, in no particular order:
