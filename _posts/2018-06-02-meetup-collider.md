As a bonus event for June, we're participating in JPMorgan's Meetup Collider!

We're going to run a [Guided Conversation](http://guidedconversations.org/) about something tech-related. Guided conversations are a friendly way to have a structured yet lightweight discussion around a topic.

A guide will make sure we stay on track, and offer questions to spark the conversation.

After the conversation ends, all the meetups will get together for lightning talks from each group.

[Tickets](https://ti.to/codecraftconf/meetupcollider) are free but required, so get one now!
