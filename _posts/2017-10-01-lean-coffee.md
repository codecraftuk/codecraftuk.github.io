For our October event, we're going to have another Lean Coffee session. Everyone has questions about software development, craftsmanship and engineering techniques that they'd like to discuss with a like-minded group: this is your chance.

Whether you want to talk about TDD in practice, how to get started with BDD, microservices, structuring code, or anything else related to developing high-quality software, bring along your topic and questions and discuss them.

It doesn't matter if you don't have a topic, you may be able to provide valuable perspective for others, or learn something new by just listening. It also doesn't matter if you don't know the Lean Coffee format, it's simple and we'll take the time to explain it before we get started.

* Details: Lean Coffee
* Date - Thursday 19th October 2017
* Time - 7pm event start
* Location: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/vWn1J">The Raven</a> on Renfield Street, Glasgow (upstairs)
