title: Draw Your Architecture
---

For our August event, we're trying something new: we've all been asked before to explaing the architecture of systems on which we work, but it's not something we do very often. We think that's a mistake.

In rotating pairs, we'll spend 15 minutes or so drawing our architecture for our partners, taking questions and ideas, and generally looking at how to improve; before doing the same for them. After a few iterations of practicing this skill, we hope to improve both the clarity of the drawing and explanation, and gain insight into our system by having fresh pairs of eyes look at it.

* Details: Draw Your Architecture
* Date - Thursday 201th August 2015
* Time - 7pm event start
* Location: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/vWn1J">The Raven</a> on Renfield Street, Glasgow (hopefully upstairs)
