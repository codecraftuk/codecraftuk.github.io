For our February event, we're going to have a [Guided Conversation](http://guidedconversations.org/) about Patterns. The idea of Patterns appear throughout various strands of software history and software craftsmanship practice,
so we want to explore what patterns are and why they're important.

It doesn't matter if you're new and haven't used patterns (or so you think), you may be able to ask just the right questions to unlock key insights for others, whilst listening in and learning for yourself. We'll explain the format ([Guided Conversations](http://guidedconversations.org/)), and make sure everyone keeps up with the discussion.

* Details: Patterns: A Guided Conversation
* Date - Thursday 16th February 2017
* Time - 7pm event start
* Location: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/vWn1J">The Raven</a> on Renfield Street, Glasgow (upstairs)
