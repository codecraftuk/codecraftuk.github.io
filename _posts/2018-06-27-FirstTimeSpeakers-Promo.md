This is our first! Our meetup usually does not run presentation based events, as we focus on events during which everyone can participate and be heard.

However, we have decided to organise a FirstTimeSpeakers event during which new speakers will be encouraged to give a 10-15 min talk about anything tech related - any stack, any softskill.  

Why? Well, because we are interested in seeing new faces and hearing of new perspectives, experiences and technologies.
We are a welcoming meetup and we can also help speakers to prepare.

If this sounds like your cup of tea, sign up to speak [here](https://codecraft2.typeform.com/to/pq1KnK)
