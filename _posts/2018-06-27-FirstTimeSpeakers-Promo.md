description: First Time Speakers! All the details about how to sign up here!
---

In general, our meetup does not run presentation based events, as we focus on events during which everyone can participate and be heard.

However, we have decided to organise a First Time Speakers event during which new speakers will be encouraged to give a 10-15 min talk about anything tech related - any stack, any soft skill.  

Why? Well, because we are interested in seeing new faces and hearing of new perspectives, experiences and technologies.
We are a welcoming meetup and we can also help speakers to prepare.

If this sounds like your cup of tea, sign up to speak [here](https://codecraft2.typeform.com/to/pq1KnK)
