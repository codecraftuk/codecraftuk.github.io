title: What is simplicity?
---

For our April event, we'll be running a workshop to help us define what is simplicity in code.

There's been a few attempts to make this subjective subject into an objective measure. The most famous is the Kent Beck's [four simple rules](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?XpSimplicityRules) which Ron Jeffries reworked into an acronym [TUBE](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/simple.html).

Evan Czaplicki, the creator of Elm, is encouraging developers to speak more directly about concepts to allow people to understand without being scared off by complicated terms. For an example of this watch nine minutes of his excellent talk at [Curry On - Prague](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYk8CKH7OhE&t=20m50s).

We don't want simplicity to be another scary topic that only a few people can speak about. Simplicity rules should be accessible for all developers.

For this workshop we will work together to create a clear and objective guide for creating simple code, that doesn't leave anything up to imagination.

Come along and join in, or just listen, as we work together to create a guide to simplicity.
