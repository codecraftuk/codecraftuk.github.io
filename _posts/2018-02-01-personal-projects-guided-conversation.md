For our February event, we're going to have a [Guided Conversation](http://guidedconversations.org/) about Personal Projects. It's that time of year when we're often looking for new challenges and projects to take on. Some of us do pet technical projects. Let's talk about that. What projects have we enjoyed? When has it caused undue stress? Should we take on these kinds of projects at all?

It doesn't matter if you're new to the industry, or whether you have personal projects or not, you may be able to ask just the right questions to unlock key insights for others, whilst listening in and learning for yourself. We'll explain the format ([Guided Conversations](http://guidedconversations.org/)), and make sure everyone keeps up with the discussion.
