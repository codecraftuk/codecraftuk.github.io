For our June event, we’re doing a Pair Programming and TDD exercise called the [Ping Pong Pattern](http://wiki.c2.com/?PairProgrammingPingPongPattern).

We’ll work through a programming exercise in pairs using the pattern and then discuss how we found the process.

Please bring along your laptops!

JP Morgan have kindly volunteered to host us at their Glasgow offices on 45 Waterloo St, Glasgow G2 6HS, so you will need to sign-up to get on the list: [CodeCraft Pair Programming Ping Pong Pattern Sign-Up](https://ti.to/codecraftconf/codecraft-pair-programming-ping-pong-pattern).

We’ll be letting people in from around 6:30pm, but no entry will be possible after 7pm, so please be sharp!
