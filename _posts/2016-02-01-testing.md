title: What Does Testing Look Like in 2016?
---

For our February event, we'll be running a <a href="http://code.joejag.com/2015/guided-conversations.html">Guided Conversation</a> entitled, "What Does Testing Look like in 2016?".

Over the last few years there's been a great deal of conversation about the role and scope of testing as practiced by software developers and software testers. Some believe that <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/is-tdd-dead/">TDD is Dead</a>, <a href="http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/06/17/IsTddDeadFinalThoughts.html">others disagree</a>.

Given modern tools and languages, at what level(s) should we test? How much should we do at each level? Do we need to test microservices at all?

Over the course of the evening, we hope to cover a wide range of questions related to the state of testing in 2016. Come along and join in, or simply listen, with a group of your peers having a conversation on an important topic.
