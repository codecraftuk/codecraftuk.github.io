It does not matter if you are new to the industry, or whether you have a broad AI knowledge â€“ we will be going over some philosophical questions concerning AI, who is responsible for it and how we can make it better.

We will explain the format ([Guided Conversations](http://guidedconversations.org/)), and make sure everyone keeps up with the discussion.
