For our June event we are going to be running a coding Kata. The exercise will involve working in pairs and following strict 'Clean Code' standards (including TDD) to implement your solutions, there is of course no right answer and we will be discussing the results at the end.

Please bring along your laptops!

Skyscanner have kindly volunteered to host us at their Glasgow offices on St. Vincent Street, so you will need to sign-up to get on the list: [CodeCraft Kata Sign-Up](https://ti.to/codecraftconf/codecraft-lift-kata)
