#FREE TICKET REQUIRED!

For our August event, we're going to have a FirstTimeSpeakers event! There will be two things happening on the night First Time Speakers Talks and Prep for future Speakers

# First Time Speakers Talks
6 speakers have been selected from the submissions for this event and they are ready to show their talks to the world. We have fantastic lightning talks lined up, with speakers from all tech backgrounds. So come long to see talks never seen before on the meetup scene! 
Schedule:
  * **6 20 - 6 30 Intro**
  * **6 30 - 6 50 Deborah Mayers : Simulating the Temple to Mithras: Using multisensory VR to (re)create the past**
Abstract: Often, artefacts from archaeological sites are decontexturalized in a museum by both space and time. VR is a way to help put these objects back into context and show change across time. But, what is the most effective way to use this technology? This talk looks at the question: does using multisensory effects (i.e. adding audio, scent, and haptic feedback) increase user presence, engagement, and learning about the way a past site functioned? And if it does, should sensory feedback be placed in all experiences? Would it be feasible to do so?
  * **6 50 - 7 10 David Brower:  Software and the Marshmallow Test**
Abstract: The theme of the talk is that for a software system to flourish and for the people who work on it to be fulfilled a company needs to be able to delay gratification I.e. work towards long term goals. Sadly, this is rarely the case.
 * **7 10 - 7 30 Andrew Craigie: glTF - the JPEG of 3D**
 Abstract: glTF (OpenGL transmission format) is file format for the transmission of 3D scenes and models written in JSON. The talk will introduce glTF, give a brief overview of the file format and its relevance to anyone interested in using 3D assets in web, VR or AR applications. A speedy run through of the workflow will demonstrate 3D model creation, exporting to glTF and using the 3D model within a web page using existing WebGL libraries. Links to demonstrations, tutorials and assets will be included.
 * **7 10 - 7 30 Break**
 * **7 45 - 8 05 Joana Bittencourt Silvestre - Bioinformatics - using computer power to fight cancer**
 Abstract: TBC
 * **8 05 - 8 20 Edward Whitley: You Can Make Web Games!: An Intro To Phaser**
 Abstract:  Introduction to developing web games with the JavaScript framework Phaser. Knowledge of JavaScript NOT required but may help. Also mentioning some recommended tools, the mission of Phaser, and a brief history web games.
 * **8 20 - 8 40 Code your Future**
Abstract: TBC


# Prep for future Speakers
In February, a wonderful new initiative has begun. The [global diversity CFP day](https://www.globaldiversitycfpday.com/) hosted workshops around the world to help new speakers emerge onto the tech scene.
We would like to carry on this tradition, and as part of the event we have a space dedicated for people who would like to speak. So if you are a soon-to-be speaker and need some help with your proposal, abstract, bio etc come along are there will be people there to help you throughout the duration of the event.
