For our July event, we're going to have a [Guided Conversation](http://guidedconversations.org/) about Collaboration. Far too often, software developers focus on improving their software through just technical practice. While that is often useful, sometimes it's worth focussing on how we work together in order to produce better software. We'll discuss the purpose of collaboration, techniques we use to achieve better collaboration, the challenges we face when trying to work together, and more.

Even if you're relatively new and have rarely worked on a team, you can still learn from the others, while asking questions that the more experienced participants might miss. We'll explain the format ([Guided Conversations](http://guidedconversations.org/)), and make sure everyone keeps up with the discussion.
