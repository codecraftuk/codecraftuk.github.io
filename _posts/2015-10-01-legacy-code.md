title: Legacy Code
---

Legacy code is something that most developers will have to deal with at some point in their careers. But just what is legacy code? Why is it a problem? What can we do to fix that? 

For our October event, we're going to have a <a href="http://code.joejag.com/2015/guided-conversations.html">guided conversation</a> about legacy code. Join us to discuss techniques for helping improve systems with legacy code, or avoiding your current system becoming legacy itself. Whether you're running a clean, green codebase or are mired in large, untested classes, your input and perspective will be extremely valuable. Come and chat with your peers about an issue that affects all developers at some point.

* Details: Legacy Code Guided Conversation
* Date - Thursday 15th October 2015
* Time - 7pm event start
* Location: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/vWn1J">The Raven</a> on Renfield Street, Glasgow (downstairs, probably in the restaurant area)
