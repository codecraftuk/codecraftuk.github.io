title: Lean Coffee for Craftmanship
---

For our April event, we're going to have a Lean Coffee session. Everyone has questions about software development, craftmanship and engineering techniques that they'd like to discuss with a like-minded group: this is your chance.

Whether you want to talk about TDD in practice, how to get started with BDD, microservices, structuring code, or anything else related to developing high-quality software, bring along your topic and questions and discuss them.

It doesn't matter if you don't have a topic, plenty of others will and you may be able to provide valuable perspective. It also doesn't matter if you don't know the Lean Coffee format, it's simple and we'll take the time to explain it before we get started.

* Details: Lean Coffee for Craftmanship
* Date - Thursday 17th APril 2014
* Time - 7pm
* Location - TBC venue in Glasgow City Centre (Follow us on Twitter to find out more)
